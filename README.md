# The-Smith-Parasite
Machine Learning Project

In this challenge, our goal is to build a predictive model that answers the question, “Who are the people more likely to suffer from the Smith Parasite?”. With that
goal, we can access a small quantity of sociodemographic, health, and behavioralinformation obtained from the patients.
As data scientists, our team is asked to analyze and transform the data available asneeded and apply different models to answer the defined question in a more accurate
way. 

Our task is to build a model that can predict if a patient will suffer, or not, from The Smith Disease.
